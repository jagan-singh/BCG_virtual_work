# BCG Virtual Work

## Task 1
Formulate the hypothesis as a data science problem and lay out the major steps needed to test this hypothesis. Communicate your thoughts and findings in an email to your LDS, focusing on the potential data that you would need from the client and analytical models you would use to test such a hypothesis.

## Task 2
Clean the data – you might have to address missing values, duplicates, data type conversions, transformations, and multicollinearity, as well as outliers. Perform some exploratory data analysis. Look into the data types, data statistics, and identify any missing data or null values, and how often they appear in the data. Visualize specific parameters as well as variable distributions.

## Task 3
Think through what key drivers of churn could be for our client. Build the features in order to get ready to model

## Task 4
Build churn model(s) to try to predict the churn probability of any customer, taking into account all the explanatory variables you have constructed in the feature engineering process. Evaluate your model, using a holdout set, and with metrics of your choosing. Be sure to pick a metric that would make sense for this business case. Interpret the results and use them to formulate your answers to the client’s hypotheses and questions. You will be asked to form these answers into coherent thoughts and recommendations in the next module.

## Task 5
Develop an executive summary slide synthesizing all the findings from the project so far, keeping in mind that this will be for the steering committee meeting which the head of the SME division, as well as other various stakeholders, will be attending.
